# Optimization-in-Cloud-Computing
  In order to reduce energy and time cost created by data center when it transfers data between machines, 
we will perform resource provisioning and task scheduling using Greedy algorithm and Round-robin scheduling algorithm 
such that total energy is minimized.
Also, later this project will present DRL-Cloud, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based RP and TS system, to minimize energy 
cost for large-scale CSPs with very large number of servers that receive enormous numbers of user requests per day.
